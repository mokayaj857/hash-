    content:
      "Era is a Substrate AppChain that anchors digital content to verified devices and decentralized identities (DIDs). It creates cryptographic proofs at capture-time, stores immutable hashes on-chain, and uses a jury-based Context Court to attach human-verified meaning. The result is a ledger of reality that proves what is real without chasing fakes.",
  },
  {
    title: "Problem Statement",
    content:
      "Detection alone cannot win the arms race against generative media. As generative capability grows faster than detection capability, the probability of reliably spotting fakes trends toward zero. Users, journalists, courts, and platforms need a way to prove authenticity instead of guessing at forgery.",

      "Hardware-rooted trust: signatures live in Secure Enclave / Android TEE, never exported.",

        name: "Content Registry Pallet",

    title: "Data Flows",
    bullets: [
      "Capture: Device hashes media and signs inside secure silicon. Client uploads media to IPFS (planned) and broadcasts hash + DID + signature + metadata.",
      "Registration: Identity Registry checks rights and device membership. Content Registry prevents duplicates and records immutable proof.",
      "Context Disputes: Accounts with Dispute rights open a case for a ContentId. Context Court summons jurors, records votes, escalates ties, and processes rewards/slashes.",
      "Verification: Verifiers recompute hashes, read on-chain proofs, and reference court outcomes to display trust badges.",
    ],
  },
  {
    title: "Security Model",
    bullets: [
      "Immutability: proofs are append-only; updates require new content IDs.",
      "Bounded storage: bounded vectors and double-maps limit state growth and weight.",
      "Economic incentives: deposits for DID creation and juror staking; slashing for non-participation or misbehavior.",
      "Randomness: on-chain randomness for juror selection; future VRF upgrade path.",
      "Permission checks: Update, Impersonate, and Dispute rights enforced for all critical actions.",
